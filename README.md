set up seq2seq model in pytorch
get regular autoencoder data
set up autoencoder in pytorch
create noisy data
convert to denoising autoencoder

check if SOTA models (BERT, GPT-2) do any kind of text denoising
check training time/cost on sdae
follow up sdna with more complexities?
look for citations on the Gibson paper to see follow-up work
read huggingface paper about reducing training time at little cost to accuracy

project proposal for now: check robustness of SOTA models to noisy channel-type
noise, what kinds of issues it creates. Link to cognitive research on how people
are affected by these kinds of noise. Train sdna to deal with these issues.
Talk about language understanding vs. prediction.
